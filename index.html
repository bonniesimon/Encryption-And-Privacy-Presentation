					<h2>What is Encryption?</h2>
					<p>Encryption is the method by which information is converted into secret code that hides the information's true meaning. </p>

				<section>
					<p>Encryption is commonly used to protect data in transit and data at rest.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Every time someone uses an ATM or buys something online with a smartphone, encryption is used to protect the information being relayed.</p>

					<h3>Quantum Computers and Encryption</h3>

				<section><img src="./img/quantum computing.jpeg" alt=""></section>
				<section>
					<p>Modern Encryption is based on the process of multiplication, which is easy to perform in one direction but much harder to do in reverse</p>
				</section>
				<section data-transition="zoom-in">
					<p>592*829 = 491,597</p>
					<p class="fragment">But it is hard to start with the number 491,597 and work out which two prime numbers must be multiplied to produce it.</p>
				</section>
				<section data-transition="zoom-out">
					<p>computer scientists consider it practically impossible for a classical computer to factor numbers that are longer than 2048 bits</p>

					<h3>Challenges to Encryption</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Brute Force Attacks</li>
						<li>Backdoors</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Backdoors</h3>
					<p>A backdoor is a typically covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer, product, embedded device, or its embodiment. </p>
					<p>They are basically a way in which people can access the data bypassing the encryption.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>National Security Agency (NSA) weakened the DES algorithm, and following revelations from former NSA analyst and contractor Edward Snowden, many believe the NSA has attempted to subvert other cryptography standards and weaken encryption products.</p>

					<h2>Privacy</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Privacy is a fundamental right, essential to autonomy and the protection of human dignity, serving as the foundation upon which many other human rights are built.</p>
					<p>Privacy enables us to create barriers and manage boundaries to protect ourselves from unwarranted interference in our lives, which allows us to negotiate who we are and how we want to interact with the world around us.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>People don't feel like their pricacy is violated because they don't know that they're being violated.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Most companies nowadays are based on data collection</p>
					<p class="fragment">Data collection is done often by breach of privacy</p>
					<p class="fragment">Instagram, Whatsapp, Facebook, Amazon, etc</p>

					<h3>Cases of Privacy concern</h3>

					<p>More than 49 million Instagram influencers, celebrities, and brands have had their private contact information exposed after an India-based social media marketing company left the data unprotected on an Amazon Web Services database.</p>
